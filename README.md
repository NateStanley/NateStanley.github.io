# Contributing
Create a PR that adds a new folder in /sites.

This should be the top domain for the site ie pehlanport.nt (nt is the official nanotrasen ending thing)

Then add it to the file sites/centralcommand.nt/directory.html

If you need examples look at the other sites in there or something.
